This file describes the structure of the preprocessing pipeline for IRDIS, and describes the parameters that can be set in the json file.

************************ PREPROCESSING (IRDIS) ******************************

# Parts of pipeline
to_do = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] # parts of pre-processing to be run. 

    #1. crop odd + bad pix corr
    #   a. with provided mask (static) => iterative because clumps
    #   b. sigma filtering (cosmic rays) => non-iterative
    #2. Recentering
    #3. final crop and master cube
    #4. plots + trim bad frames
    #   a. Plots before rejection
    #   b. Rejection
    #   c. Plots after rejection
    #5. FWHM + unsat flux (PSF)
    #   a. Gaussian
    #   b. Airy
    #6. final OBJ cube and binning (if requested)
    #7. final ADI cubes and PSF frames
    #8. final scale list
overwrite = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]  # list of bools corresponding to parts of pre-processing to be run again even if files already exist. Same order as to_do
debug = True # whether to print more info - useful for debugging
save_space = False # whether to progressively delete intermediate products as new products are calculated (can save space but will make you start all over from the beginning in case of bug)
plot = 0  # whether to plot additional info (evo of: Strehl, cross-corr level, airmass, flux)
nproc = 1  # number of processors to use - default is cpu_count()/2 for efficiency

# OBS
coro = True   # whether the observations were coronagraphic or not
coro_sz = 12  # if coronagraphic, provide radius of the coronagraph in pixels (check header for size in mas and convert)


# Preprocessing options
rec_met = "satspots"     # recentering method. choice among {"gauss_2dfit", "moffat_2dfit", "dft_nn", "satspots", "radon", "speckle"} # either a single string or a list of string to be tested. If not provided will try both gauss_2dfit and dft. Note: "nn" stand for upsampling factor, it should be an integer (recommended: 100)
rec_met_psf = "dft_100"
xy_spots = [[105,169], [171,181], [117,103], [183,115]] # if recentering by satspots, provide here the pixel coordinates of the satellite spots before bad pixel correction in pre-processing. Two possibilities for the format:
a) provide a list of 4 lists (with 2 elements each):  top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right spots xy coordinates in the first channel's raw images. Position in other channel(s) will be inferred from wavelength scaling. Note: do not do that for IRDIS!
b) provide a list of n_ch lists of 4 lists (e.g. n_ch is 2 for DBI): in that case all the coordinates for each channel are provided. CHECK in "_left" and "_right" calibrated cen cubes!
sigfactor = 5 # Threshold in sigma to be used in the subimages where gaussian/moffat models are fitted to satellite spots to fing their centroid
badfr_crit_names = ['corr','bkg'] # Bad frame criteria to be used for OBJ cubes; choice between{'stat','ell','corr','bkg','shifts'}. See description below. NOTE: For very good AO correction, it seems the algorithm used in badfrellipticity() routine (i.e. 'ell' option) would sometimes fail to detect the star! Too many rings? Only use for mediocre to very bad Strehl.
badfr_crit_names_psf = ['corr'] # Bad frame criteria to be used for PSF cubes; same description as badfr_crit_names.
# stat: rej based on mean counts in either circle or annulus.
	- "mode": area in which stats are calculated, choice between {'annulus', "circle"}. Default: circle (non-coro), annulus (coro)
	- "rad": radius for the considered area in fwhm. If annulus: correspond to the inner radius of the annulus. Default: 2*fwhm (non-coro), coro_sz+1 (coro).
	- "width": width = [int(4*coro_sz), 0]  # width in fwhm (only used if area is an annulus). Default: 2*fwhm.
	- "thr_top": top sigma threshold; a frame is considered bad if mean pixel intensity in area is larger than median+thr_top*sigma(cfr. description of vip_hci.cube_detect_badfr_pxstats). Default: 1.0
	- "thr_low": lower sigma threshold; a frame is considered bad if mean pixel intensity in area is larger than median+thr_top*sigma(cfr. description of vip_hci.cube_detect_badfr_pxstats). Default: 1.0
# ell: rej based on psf ellipticity
	- "roundhi": cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: 0.2
	- "roundlo": cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: -0.2
	- "crop_sz": in fwhm, cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: 10 (for 10*fwhm crop)
# corr: rej based on correlation level with a frame or median frame. Possible dico entries: 
	- "thr": min correlation level with median frame. Notes: supersedes perc if both are provided; use "plot" to check a plot of correlation level for the frames of the cube.
	- "perc": min percentile for bad frames (e.g. if set to 10, the 10% worst frames in the cube will be automatically rejected) . Default: 0
	- "ref": "median" or int (index of ref frame to be used)
	- "crop_sz": in pixels. Default: 31.
	- "dist": Type of distance/correlation to be used. Cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_correlation. Default: "pearson"
	- "mode": {'full', 'annulus'}. Whether to calculate the distance over the full (cropped) image or an annulus.
	- "inradius": [mode='annulus'] the inner radius of the annulus.
	- "width": [mode='annulus'] the width of the annulus.
	NOTE: if using perc, final number of bad frames can be larger than perc if other criteria are provided.
badfr_crit = [{"thr":0.9,"ref":"median"},{"thr":"2"}] # List of dictionaries indicating thresholds & parameters to be used for each bad frame criterion.
badfr_crit_psf  # Same as badfr_crit but for unsaturated PSF.
badfr_idx = [[5,6,7],None] # Whether to force some frames to be removed (e.g. if impossible to identify with criteria but clear by eye)
max_bpix_nit = 10  # sets the maximum number of iterations on a frame to correct bpix. Can reduce processing time, but may miss bad pixels if set too low
