This file describes the structure of the preprocessing pipeline for IRDIS, and describes the parameters that can be set in the json file.

************************ PREPROCESSING (IRDIS) ******************************

# OBS
coro = True  # whether the observations were coronagraphic or not
coro_sz = 12  # if coronagraphic, provide radius of the coronagraph in pixels (check header for size in mas and convert)
#dit_irdis = 64.      # read later from header
#dit_psf_irdis = 4.   # read later from header

# Parts of pipeline to be run/overwritten
to_do = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} # parts of pre-processing to be run. 
    #1. crop odd + bad pix corr
    #   a. with provided mask (static) => iterative because clumps
    #   b. sigma filtering (cosmic rays) => non-iterative
    #2. Recentering
    #3. Make first master cube + derot angles calculation
    #4. anamorphism correction + final ADI cube writing
    #5. fine recentering based on bkg star (if relevant)
    #6. bad frame rejection
    #   a. Plots before rejection
    #   b. Rejection
    #   c. Plots after rejection
    #7. final PSF cube + FWHM + unsat flux (PSF)
    #   a. Gaussian
    #   b. Airy
    #8. Subtract satspots if 'CENTER' used as object (e.g. if OBJ is a ref cube)
    #9. final ADI cube (bin+crop)
    #10. Calculate scale factors (if DBI)

overwrite = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]  # list of bools corresponding to parts of pre-processing to be run again even if files already exist. Same order as to_do
debug = True # whether to print more info - useful for debugging
save_space = False # whether to progressively delete intermediate products as new products are calculated (can save space but will make you start all over from the beginning in case of bug)


# Preprocessing options
rec_met = "satspots"     # recentering method. choice among {"gauss_2dfit", "moffat_2dfit", "dft_nn", "satspots", "radon", "speckle"} # either a single string or a list of string to be tested. If not provided will try both gauss_2dfit and dft. Note: "nn" stand for upsampling factor, it should be an integer (recommended: 100)
rec_met_psf = "dft_100"
sigfactor=3. # float corresponding to the SNR threshold used (anything below the threshold is set to 0) before fitting 2D Moffat or Gaussian to find the centroid of either the satellite spots or bkg star.
xy_spots = [[[452,559], [515,559], [451,494], [518,494]],[[452,559], [515,559], [451,494], [518,494]]] # if recentering by satspots provide here the coordinates of the satellite spots. Two possibilities for the format:
a) provide a list of 4 lists (with 2 elements each) (e.g. in CI mode):  top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right spots xy coordinates in the first channel's raw images. Position in other channel(s) will be inferred from wavelength scaling. Note: do not do that for IRDIS!
b) provide a list of n_ch lists of 4 lists (e.g. n_ch is 2 for DBI): in that case all the coordinates for each channel are provided. CHECK in "_left" and "_right" calibrated cen cubes!
!!! WARNING: these positions can change from one dataset to another, and forgetting to adapt them can lead to a bad centering of the final frames. Examples:
- for CI: "xy_spots": [[105,169], [171,181], [117,103], [183,115]]
- for DBI-H23: "xy_spots": [[[452,559], [515,559], [451,494], [518,494]],[[452,559], [515,559], [451,494], [518,494]]]
- for DBI-K12: "xy_spots": [[[435,568], [524,569], [434,480], [524,479]],[[435,558], [530,558], [434,464], [530,464]]]

badfr_crit_names = ['corr','bkg'] # Bad frame criteria to be used for OBJ cubes; choice between{'stat','ell','corr','bkg','shifts'}. See description below. NOTE: For very good AO correction, it seems the algorithm used in badfrellipticity() routine (i.e. 'ell' option) would sometimes fail to detect the star! Too many rings? Only use for mediocre to very bad Strehl.
badfr_crit_names_psf = ['corr'] # Bad frame criteria to be used for PSF cubes; same description as badfr_crit_names.
# stat: rej based on mean counts in either circle or annulus.
	- "mode": area in which stats are calculated, choice between {'annulus', "circle"}. Default: circle (non-coro), annulus (coro)
	- "rad": radius for the considered area in fwhm. If annulus: correspond to the inner radius of the annulus. Default: 2*fwhm (non-coro), coro_sz+1 (coro).
	- "width": width = [int(4*coro_sz), 0]  # width in fwhm (only used if area is an annulus). Default: 2*fwhm.
	- "thr_top": top sigma threshold; a frame is considered bad if mean pixel intensity in area is larger than median+thr_top*sigma(cfr. description of vip_hci.cube_detect_badfr_pxstats). Default: 1.0
	- "thr_low": lower sigma threshold; a frame is considered bad if mean pixel intensity in area is larger than median+thr_top*sigma(cfr. description of vip_hci.cube_detect_badfr_pxstats). Default: 1.0
# ell: rej based on psf ellipticity
	- "roundhi": cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: 0.2
	- "roundlo": cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: -0.2
	- "crop_sz": in fwhm, cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_ellipticity(). Default: 10 (for 10*fwhm crop)
# bkg: rej based on flux of bkg star
	- "thr": min number of sigmas below the median flux of the star for a frame to be considered bad. Default: 3
	NOTE: the approx_xy_bkg should be set to a list of 2 floats for this criterion to be used (see below)
# shifts: rej based on shift amplitude (compared to (x,y) shifts inferred for good CEN image)
	- "thr": min amplitude of shift in pixels for the corresponding frame to be considered bad.
	- "err": nominal uncertainty on true position of the star in coronagraphic observations (cfr. Maire et al. 2016). Default: 0.4 px
# corr: rej based on correlation level with a frame or median frame. Possible dico entries: 
	- "thr": min correlation level with median frame. Notes: supersedes perc if both are provided; use "plot" to check a plot of correlation level for the frames of the cube.
	- "perc": min percentile for bad frames (e.g. if set to 10, the 10% worst frames in the cube will be automatically rejected) . Default: 0
	- "ref": "median" or int (index of ref frame to be used)
	- "crop_sz": in fwhm. Default: 6.
	- "dist": Type of distance/correlation to be used. Cfr. description of vip_hci.preproc.cube_detect_badfr_correlation. Default: "pearson"
	NOTE: if using perc, final number of bad frames can be larger than perc if other criteria are provided.

badfr_idx = [[5,6,7],None] # Whether to force some frames to be removed (e.g. if impossible to identify with criteria but clear by eye)

badfr_crit = [{"thr":0.9,"ref":"median"},{"thr":"2"}] # List of dictionaries indicating thresholds & parameters to be used for each bad frame criterion. IMPORTANT: provide a dictionary for each bad frame criterion called in the badfr_crit_names list, define an empty dictionary {} if needed.
badfr_crit_psf = [{"thr":0.9,"ref":"median"},{"thr":"2"}] # Same as above, for PSF.

approx_xy_bkg = 0 # can be 0 or a list of 2 floats: [x,y] coords of background star in the ADI frame obtained after rough centering (named "median_ADI1_<filter>.fits") and optionally (recommended) distortion correction (named "median_ADI2_<filter>_DistCorr.fits"). NOTE: the pipeline should thus FIRST be run up to step #3 or #4, to then be able to set this value if any bkg star present, and then run it again for the subsequent steps. 

snr_thr_bkg = 3. # float corresponding to SNR threshold to select images of the sequence for consideration to compute shifts.

good_cen_idx = None # None or int. If some CEN cubes are bad (i.e. star not exactly behind coronagraphic mask), this should be the index of a good CEN cube. If not provided, will assume all CEN cubes have the star perfectly behind mask. Will be used for star-BKG radius and differential shifts. Default: None (i.e. not provided in .json file)
